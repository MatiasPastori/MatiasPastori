- 👋 Hi, I’m @MatiasPastori
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills and mastering the ones i already have experience with
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react and my current job keeps me focused with Angular and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small libraries for front-end oriented projects or web-apps to help solve regular situations or requests. This kind of collaborations would help me
get more experience in the field and also give me the chance to make some contributions to the community.
